# Swiggy Funnel Analysis 2019

## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth funnel analysis of Swiggy's performance throughout the year 2019. By examining the various stages of the customer journey on the Swiggy platform—from landing on the app or website to placing an order—this analysis identifies critical drop-off points and areas of high engagement. The project aims to uncover the underlying reasons behind fluctuations in order levels and traffic, offering actionable insights for optimizing the user experience and boosting conversion rates.

## Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify and analyze the highs and lows in Swiggy's order levels and web traffic on a date-wise basis throughout 2019. By correlating these metrics with external factors such as promotional campaigns, seasonal trends, and competitive actions, the analysis constructs a comprehensive narrative of Swiggy's performance over the year.

## Key Findings

- **Traffic Analysis**: Significant fluctuations in traffic were observed throughout the year, with notable peaks during major festivals and promotional campaigns. Conversely, dips in traffic were often linked to technical issues or increased competition.
- **Order Levels**: Order levels generally mirrored traffic trends, with spikes during high-traffic periods and declines when traffic dropped. However, other factors like average delivery charges, discounts, and out-of-stock items also had a substantial impact on order volumes.
- **Conversion Rates**: The analysis revealed that conversion rates from different stages of the funnel (e.g., from menu to cart, cart to payment) were highly sensitive to factors such as pricing, discounts, and technical issues.

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using data collected from Swiggy's internal analytics tools. The dataset includes metrics such as daily order counts, unique visitors, page views, session durations, and bounce rates. These were analyzed using statistical methods to determine significant trends and patterns. The results were further interpreted to provide qualitative insights.

### Data Sources

- **Daily Order Counts**
- **Unique Visitors**
- **Page Views**
- **Session Durations**
- **Bounce Rates**

### Tools Used

- **Excel**: For data organization and preliminary analysis.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Additional Insights

- **Impact of Discounts**: A strong correlation was found between the average discount offered and the conversion rate. Higher discounts generally led to higher conversion rates.
- **Technical Issues**: Issues such as out-of-stock items and high delivery charges were identified as significant deterrents to conversion, often leading to substantial drops in order levels.
- **Competitor Actions**: The analysis also took into account the impact of competitors' strategies, such as aggressive discounting and the introduction of new features, on Swiggy's performance.

## Conclusion

This project provides a detailed examination of Swiggy's 2019 performance, offering valuable insights into the factors influencing customer behavior and order levels. The findings are intended to inform Swiggy's strategic decisions, helping the company refine its marketing tactics, improve user engagement, and ultimately drive higher conversion rates.
